This basic b course will not make you a C ninja.
For that reason, it's super important to acknowledge that unless you get better,
you will blow stuff up (in a bad way).
Like, your exploit or malware code may fail.
You may mess up production systems on accident.
Bad things will happen.
So please.... Just *start* here. But keep learning, and keep practicing.
This course only covers the basics, and it does it very quickly...
Ha. Alright, cool. Let's do this.
